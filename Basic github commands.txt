General git information: https://git-scm.com/book/nl/v1/Branchen-in-Git-Wat-is-een-branch

First: open the shell in the github application
	repository --> open in powershell

When starting, always pull the files from github.com/ to update 
	git pull OR git pull origin master (if you just want the files from the master branch)

Push file from local pc:
	Assuming the file with code is the branch folder on your local pc:
	
	git add [file].[type] ,SO --> git add Testfile.txt
	git commit -m "type message ", SO git commit -m "a change in file x"(document change, -m is to add message)
	git push -u [location name] [branch name], SO --> git push -u origin master

Push folder from local pc:
	note: git does NOT store empty folders, so make sure to add a file to a folder before pushing it!
	git add [folder_name]
	git commit -m 'type message'
	git push  

Remove file from github:
	git rm (--cached) [file_name], SO git rm Testfile.txt (cached is not necessary)
	git commit -m 'message '
	git push

General help:
	Git help
	
View Directory:
	ls
	
When creating a complete new repo:
	git remote add origin https://github.com/username/RepositoryName
	
View status (to view whether everything is up to date):
	git status

To view recent activity:
	git log
	
Switch branch
	git checkout [branch_name_to_switch_to]
	
create new branch	
	git branch [branch_name]
	OR git checkout -b [branch_name]

Push new branch to repository
	git push -u origin <branch_name>

To view a particular commit (if you made some changes to code and want to open 
some previous version):

	git checkout [commit_stamp] , like--> git checkout edc5d2ad6a4c06428240a9efc256decb82572ac0

OR create temporary branch to store commit in:

	git checkout -b [test_branch] [commit_stamp]
	git checkout master
	git branch -d [test_branch]

Merge temp branch with master branch (to retrieve an old version of code):
	git checkout -B master [test_branch]
	OR
	git branch -f master [test_branch]
	git checkout master

	(git push origin master)
